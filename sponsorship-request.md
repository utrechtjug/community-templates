Hello,

Thodoris Bais here, Founder & Leader of [Utrecht Java User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Utrecht-Java-User-Group/).
Our community has been growing a lot during the last [#] years, so, I would like to kindly ask you to help us continue this initiative by providing us with [number] free ([name of the ticket]) ticket.

We will perform a draw in a few days from now.

Of course, we will promote the event, as proof of cooperation, as much as we can.

Best Regards,
Thodoris Bais
