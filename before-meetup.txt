Hello [name],

thank you for your interest in presenting your session at Utrecht JUG.

1) Could I have a short description (2-3 lines) for the following questions?

- What [name] says about the presentation
- Who is [name]

2) How long does your session last (rough estimation)?

3) Are you going to live demo something or just make usage of slides (this question helps us estimate our recording procedure) ?

4) I would also like to kindly ask you to include our logo in ALL of your slides, since it will then become more handy for us to edit the video.

Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Thodoris
