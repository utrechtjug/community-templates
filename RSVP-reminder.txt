Hi Utrecht JUG-er,

You've RSVPed "Yes" for tomorrow's [meetup-name]. The meetup is fully booked and we're looking forward to seeing you!

We still have a very long waitlist with (at this moment 21) members who also want to attend the meetup.

So when your schedule has changed and you're not able to attend the meetup next [day-of-the-meetup], then please update your RSVP today, so another member can attend the meetup instead of you.

See you [tomorrow?]!

The Utrecht JUG Team
