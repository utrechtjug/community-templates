Hello Utrecht JUGer,

Less than a week to host [names].

Next [day] [date] we gather at [venue] to have a great evening once again; the very first for 2019.

In case something changed in your plans and you cannot make it, please update your RSVP, so that we give the chance to someone else from the waitlist to attend; an already big waitlist, so, for the ones who are waitlisted, please keep an eye on your notifications, because there is a chance your RSVP might automatically be changed to "Going" when someone cancels their RSVP.

See you next [day]!

Have a nice weekend,
The Utrecht JUG Team
