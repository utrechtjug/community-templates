The role of a host is to make sure that an Utrecht JUG event becomes a success. Therefore, we came up with the following points, so that there are clear agreements between the two parties (Utrecht JUG and the specific host).

Below a list with the most important points:

- The host arranges a professional buffet (and preferrably no pizzas), which among others includes vegeterian options as well.
- Hosting an event does not necessarily mean a host may provide a speaker. Ultimately, the Utrecht JUG remains responsible for the content of the meetup. That does not mean that it is impossible for a host to provide a speaker.
- When a host delivers a speaker, the host needs to make sure that the talk of their speaker is not a marketing pitch, but a technical talk which shows a real use-case scenario.
- The host makes sure that the event does not become a recruitment event.
- The host makes sure the food/buffet to be served is served at an easy-to-see and reach area within the venue.
- The host may place their own banners in the venue, but the banner next to the speaker should preferrably be an Utrecht JUG one.
- Utrecht JUG makes sure that the host is well promoted in Utrecht JUG's social media.
- Utrecht JUG thanks the host twice, once during the intro and onceduring the outro of the event.
- Utrecht JUG keeps the host posted regarding the expected number of expected attendees, so that the host could estimate the logistics (food, etc.) better .


Good to know for the host:
The host has the option to adjust the order for the (quantity of the) food up to 1 day in advance; since that our events are free, there is a chance that a number of participants will finally not show up; our experience estimates that around 20% no shows
