Utrecht Java User Group refers to anyone around Netherlands, interested in Java and Open Source development. We are a young and energetic JUG that advocates Java technology through four main pillars: monthly meetups, Devoxx4kids, Speakers Incubator and uJCP.

Whether you are a professional in the field, an enthusiast , a student looking to build your career in Java development, or just somebody looking for good food and free beer, we'd love to see you at one of our meetups.

The "official language" is English, so that non-Dutch speakers can also participate easily.

Looking forward to meeting you all and exchange knowledge and ideas! Follow us on twitter @utrechtjug to stay tuned.
